    "# Exercise Sheet 3: Collaborative Filtering with Steam Games\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will build a collaborative filtering recommender system using data we gather from Steam. We will use your friends list to get information about owned games for each ID, and the time each game was played.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, collaborative filtering is based on some sort of rating to determine the similarity between users. However, for games, the enjoyment and a rating do not always match. Additionally, only about 10% of players actually rate the games they play, which would make for a very incomplete dataset. Therefore, the playtime will be used instead of a rating system. This has the added benefit that playtime is usually the most authentic metric of enjoyment, as players are very unlikely to spend much time on a game they don't enjoy."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Your first task is to **gather the data** needed to create the recommender system. **Create a data structure** that holds the needed information for each player and game. To do this, **open the URL** with the given `request()` function, **read** the json response and retrieve your games library and playtime. Then **save** the games into a dictionary with `key=name` and `values=playtime`. **Do not add** games with 0 playtime to this dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** \n",
    "- You have three different options to solve this exercise. You can either:\n",
    "    - Use your own Steam profile (strongly recommended)\n",
    "    - Use the provided default Steam account (in case you do not own a Steam profile)\n",
    "    - Use the provided .json file (in case you do not have a Steam profile and the default Steam account becomes overcrowded)\n",
    "- your choice will not affect your grade in any way\n",
    "- You cannot obtain a list from your profile with the Steam API unless your profile is set to public. \n",
    "- Upon executing the code below, you will notice that a lot of profiles \"`couldnt decode`\". These are private or deleted profiles and it is totally fine to get this message.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "- In case you wish to use your own Steam profile, but are afraid to share your personal [key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) [1] and id, please be informed that you can delete them **after** solving the tasks and before submitting your solutions. The outputs will be saved in the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- To obtain the games a user owns, use this: `games = data['response']['games']`. This returns a list of games, including the playtime (in minutes) which can be retrieved like this: `playtime = game['playtime_forever']`, where game refers to an item from the list of games. "
